# Tailwind

Using HTML and Tailwind CSS classes only generate a webpage for the following request:

```
Design a calming and user-friendly landing page for a holistic Yoga studio, focusing on offering Yoga classes and courses for all, run by a certified Yoga instructor. Reflect the universal accessibility of yoga and the expertise of the instructor through the website's design and layout.
```

Use `div` as main container rather than `body`. Do not set any styles on this element.

Most but not all sections should be 100vh. Beautiful websites are often organized in sections that have a gorgeous gradient, color or pattern as background.

Use a mix of shadows, nice colors from the Tailwind CSS palette, background colors and gradients to make the result look well balanced, aesthetically pleasant and fit the vibe of the request. Don't limit yourself to white, black, grays and blue.

Add decorative images to make the page look more interesting. For images leave the `src` attribute empty and add a good description as `alt` attribute for screen readers.

Output only the HTML body (no doctype, head, scripts etc). Start with ```html
